A list of "items" are available to create the surveypro.
This list of "items" is divided into: "fields" and "format" elements.
Fields and formats are pluggable so each developer can create a new kind of field, i.e. a new kind of question, to use it is his special surveypro.
In the starting release of surveypro was crafted with:
• 17 items of type "field"
• 3 items of type "format"

The 17 fields type are:
• item type "integer" to ask for question like: "How old were you at you first access to narcotic"
• item type "autofill" to autofill a field with infos from user, course, time, date or surveypro
• item type "boolean" to ask for question like: "Is this true?"
• item type "character" to ask for question like: "write down your email" or "enter your personal web site URL" or "enter the PIN code of your card"
• item type "checkbox" to ask for question like: "what do you usually eat for breakfast? milk, sugar, jam, chocolate, other..."
• item type "date" to ask for question like: "When were you born?"
• item type "datetime" to ask for question like... well, this item type is really useless, AFAIK, but it was too simple to develop
• item type "fileupload" to ask for question like: "Please, upload your CV in PDF format"
• item type "integer" to ask for question like: "how many dogs do you feed dayly?"
• item type "multiselect" to ask for question like: "what do you usually eat for breakfast? milk, sugar, jam, chocolate, other..."
• item type "numeric" to ask for question like: "how many chilgdren do you have?"
• item type "radiobutton" to ask for question like: "where do you usually spend your summer holidays? sea, mountain, lake, hills, desert..."
• item type "rate" to ask for question like: "please order the following list of foreign languages according to your preferences: EN, ES, IT, FR..."
• item type "select" to ask for question like: "where do you usually spend your summer holidays? sea, mountain, lake, hills, desert..."

• item type "textarea" to ask for question like: "enter a small description of what you saw"
• item type "time" to ask for question like: "At what time do you usually get breakfast?"

The 3 format type are:
• item type "fieldset" to group your question
• item type "pagebreak"
• item type "label" to display labels in the surveypro page

Each item (== fields + formats) is hight configurable.
Each field/format item, share a part of its settings with the other fields/formats.
On the opposite, each field/format has a very special set of setting.

The common field settings are usually divided into three fieldset:
• General settings
• Availability
• Branching
and they are:
• General settings->Content: the content of the question
• General settings->Extra row for question: use this to put your "question content" in a dedicated row just upper the elements to enter the answer. If you do not check this box the "question content" will be displayed on the left of the elements to enter the answer.
• General settings->Question notes: use this option to add a comment to your item. It was added to provide help to fill the form.
• General settings->Question number: this is

• Availability->Advanced search formHelp with Advanced search form: <<TODO: add the the description>>
• Branching->Parent: <<TODO: add the the description>>
