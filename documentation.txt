What surveypro does

Surveypro is a moodle module to create custom surveys.
User can create custom surveys such as create standard surveys.
Standard surveys managed by surveypro are: ATTLS, COLLES and CI.

The main news of surveypro are:
• question branching
• required fields
• element level validation
• elements limited to teachers only

Surveypro has pluggable plugins for:
• field elements
• format elements
• preset templates
• reoprts

How a surveypro module page appears
• to students
• to teachers

A surveypro can be delivered in a lot of different ways for a lot of different purposes.
Because of this some settings were added to personalize each surveypro.
Settings are divided into: global site settings level and instance settings level.
You can get the first through Administration -> Plugins -> Activity modules -> Survey

This set of settings includes...
... for the surveypro module:
• Max input delay: the maximum time allowed to finalize a surveypro response once paused. A surveypro can be paused so the user is alloed to stop its compilation and start it again in a second time.
• Extra note in search form: Sometimes the content of the element question is not enough to exactly describe what an element is really asking. Because of this elements can be equipped with some extra detail. Must these details be displayed in the search form too?
• Filling instruction in search form: some elements are equipped with a short "Instruction guide". For instance: "An email is expected here" or "Only numbers lower than 50 are expected here". Must these "Instruction guides" be displayed in the search form too?

... for "age" surveypro plugin:
• Maximum age: simply the maximum age allowed all over the site. This value can be further restricted by a similar setting at element level.

... for "integer" surveypro plugin:
• Maximum integer: simply the maximum integer allowed all over the site. This value can be further restricted by a similar setting at element level.

... for "ATTLS (20 item version)", "COLLES (Actual)" ,"COLLES (Preferred and Actual)" and "COLLES (Preferred)" surveypro plugin:
• Position of attls elements question: the place where the question of each element will be located. The position usually depends from the size of the monitor of the foreseen class.
• Style of the choice elements: Standard surveys like ATTLS, COLLES and CI are mainly made by multichoice questions. They can be realized using radiobuttons or drop down menu both.

In addition to global site settings level, affecting EACH surveypro, surveypro provides a set of instance level settings.
They are:
• Available from: the first date available for students to fill a survey..
• Available to: the last date available for students to fill a survey.
• Branches increase pagese: a branch in the survey is always followed by an automatic page break in the survey.
• Allow Save/Resume: allow to pause a survey in order to resume and submit it in a second data entry session.
• Preserve history: Preserves saved response denying any modification to DEFINITELY submitted answers. Until the response is "in progress" (whether used in conjunction with "Allow Save/Resume" setting) you will be allowed to continue its compilation. Once it is submitted as "closed" if you go to edit it again, you will be forced to edit and save a copy of it in order to preserve the history of your original response.
• Anonymous responses: the responses management table does not show the owner of the responses and reports are anonymous.
• Minimum allowed year: the minimum number of responses a student is allowed to submit for this activity. This value can be further restricted at element level.
• Maximum allowed year: the maximum number of responses a student is allowed to submit for this activity. This value can be further restricted at element level.
• Custom style sheet: a personal cascade style sheet (css) for the current surveypro only
• Maximum allowed attempts: The maximum number of responses a student is allowed to submit for this activity.
• Notify role: The role whose members will receive a notification email at each user response. The email will only advise about response from the user, not about its content and without sender details.
• More notifications: Some additional email addresses to notify about new responses. Addresses are supposed to be one per row.
• Thanks web page: The html code of the web page the user get at each response closing time.
• Deadline of risky modification session: Allow users permitted to manage survey elements to force modifications of this survey even once already answered.

A list of "elements" are available to create the surveypro.
This list of "elements" is divided into: "fields" and "format" elements.
Fields and formats are pluggable so each developer can create a new kind of field, i.e. a new kind of question, to use it is his special surveypro.
In the starting release of surveypro was crafted with:
• 17 items of type "field"
• 3 items of type "format"

The 18 fields type are:
• element type "age" to ask for question like: "How old were you when you learned to ride a bike?"
• element type "autofill" to autofill a field with infos from user, course, time, date or surveypro
• element type "boolean" to ask for question like: "Is this true?"
• element type "character" to ask for question like: "Write down your email" or "Enter your personal web site URL" or "Enter the PIN code of your card"
• element type "checkbox" to ask for question like: "What do you usually get for breakfast?" A: "milk, sugar, jam, chocolate, other..."
• element type "date" to ask for question like: "When were you born?"
• element type "datetime" to ask for question like: "Please, write down date and time of your last flight to Los Angeles."
• element type "fileupload" to ask for question like: "Upload your CV in PDF format"
• element type "integer" to ask for question like: "How many brothers/sisters do you have?"
• element type "multiselect" to ask for question like: "What do you usually get for breakfast?" A: "milk, sugar, jam, chocolate"
• element type "numeric" to ask for question like: "Write the best approximation of π you can remember"
• element type "radiobutton" to ask for question like: "Where do you usually spend your summer holidays?" A: "sea, mountain, lake, hills, desert..."

• element type "textarea" to ask for question like: "Write a short description of yourself"
• element type "time" to ask for question like: "At what time do you usually get up in the morning in the working days?"" A: "7:00"

The 4 format type are:
• element type "fieldset" to group your question
• element type "fieldsetend" to close an opened fieldset
• element type "pagebreak"
• element type "label" to display labels in the surveypro page

Each element (== fields + formats) is hight configurable.
It has part of its settings shared with all the other fields and formats and, on the opposite side, has a very special set of personal settings.

The common field settings are usually divided into three fieldset:
• General settings
• Availability
• Branching
The very special set of personal setting of each item is always enclosed in a specific fieldset named:
• <<element type>> specific settings
• Validation options

and they are:
• General settings->Content: the text content of the element as it will be shown to remote user.
• General settings->Required(*): a flag to make the element mandatory or optional
• General settings->Indent: the indent of the element alias the left margin the element will respect once drawn.
• General settings->Question position: the position of the content of the element. It can be to the left of the user interface, in a dedicated row just upper the interface to enter the answer or in a dedicated row just upper the interface spanning all the row. Note: The left position forces element contents to plain text without images. The two 'top' positions are usually needed for contents longer than few words and are required for questions containing images!
• General settings->Element number: the custom number of the element. It may be a natural number such as 1 or 1.a or whatever you may choose. Take in mind that you are responsible for coherence of that numbers. Because of this take care if you plan to change the order of the elements.
• General settings->Hide filling instruction(*): elements are equipped with filling instructions explaining what each user is supposed to enter in the field. This flag allow to hide this instructions.
• General settings->Variable: the name of the element once it is downloaded
• General settings->Additional note: use this option to add a personal comment to your item. It help improving instructions to fill the element.
(*) few field may miss this setting because not applicable

• Availability->Hidden: to hide the element. Hided elements will not be available at all. You can consider these elements as not part of the survey.
• Availability->Search form: <<TODO: add the the description>>
• Availability->Reserved element: <<TODO: add the the description>>

• Branching->Parent element: <<TODO: add the the description>>
• Branching->Parent content: <<TODO: add the the description>>

• <<element type>> specific settings->
• Validation options

Relevant not so common features:
    -> relational db creation
    -> possibility to use "values" different from "labels" for checkboxes, radiobutton, select, multiselect and rate
    -> conditional branching
    -> export format
    -> user templates to store and quickly paste sets of items
    -> very close input validation
    -> a lot of examples among tests/fixtures/usertemplate describing each possible use of each core elements
