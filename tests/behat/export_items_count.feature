Feature: adding a fileupload item, two more item are added to export type menu
  In order to test that adding a fileupload item, two more item are added to export type menu
  As teacher1
  I fill build a surveypro without and, later, with fileupload and go to verify export type menu items

  @javascript
  Scenario: count the number of items of export type menu
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname                     | shortname        | category | groupmode |
      | Count export type menu items | Count menu items | 0        | 0         |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | teacher  | teacher1@nowhere.net |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course           | role           |
      | teacher1 | Count menu items | editingteacher |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity  | name             | intro                     | course           |
      | surveypro | Export-item test | To check export type menu | Count menu items |
    And surveypro "Export-item test" contains the following items:
      | type   | plugin      |

    And I am on the "Export-item test" "surveypro activity" page logged in as "teacher1"
    And I navigate to "Survey > Export" in current page administration

    Then "//select[contains(@id, 'id_downloadtype')]//option[contains(@value, '1')]" "xpath_element" should exist
    Then "//select[contains(@id, 'id_downloadtype')]//option[contains(@value, '2')]" "xpath_element" should exist
    Then "//select[contains(@id, 'id_downloadtype')]//option[contains(@value, '3')]" "xpath_element" should exist
    Then "//select[contains(@id, 'id_downloadtype')]//option[contains(@value, '4')]" "xpath_element" should exist
    Then "//select[contains(@id, 'id_downloadtype')]//option[contains(@value, '5')]" "xpath_element" should exist

    And I follow "Layout"
    And I follow "delete_item_2"
    And I press "Yes"

    And I navigate to "Survey > Export" in current page administration

    Then "//select[contains(@id, 'id_downloadtype')]//option[contains(@value, '1')]" "xpath_element" should exist
    Then "//select[contains(@id, 'id_downloadtype')]//option[contains(@value, '2')]" "xpath_element" should exist
    Then "//select[contains(@id, 'id_downloadtype')]//option[contains(@value, '3')]" "xpath_element" should exist
    Then "//select[contains(@id, 'id_downloadtype')]//option[contains(@value, '4')]" "xpath_element" should not exist
    Then "//select[contains(@id, 'id_downloadtype')]//option[contains(@value, '5')]" "xpath_element" should not exist
