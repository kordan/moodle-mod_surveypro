      | surveypro | Duplicate response sp | Test response duplication | Duplicate response |
    And surveypro "Duplicate response sp" contains the following items:

    And I set the field "Is it true?" to "Yes"
    And I press "Submit"
    And I press "Continue to responses list"

    # Duplicate my original response
    And I click on "//a[contains(@id,'duplicate_submission_row_1')]" "xpath_element"
    Then I should see "Are you sure you want to duplicate the response created on"
    Then I should see "and never modified?"
    And I press "Continue"

    # Edit the duplicatet response
    And I click on "//a[contains(@id,'edit_submission_row_2')]" "xpath_element"
    And I set the field "Is it true?" to "No"
    And I press "Submit"

    And I press "Continue to responses list"
    # Duplicate my original edited response

    And I log out

    When I am on the "Duplicate response sp" "surveypro activity" page logged in as admin
    And I select "Responses" from the "jump" singleselect
    # Duplicate other original response
    And I click on "//a[contains(@id,'duplicate_submission_row_1')]" "xpath_element"
    Then I should see "Are you sure you want to duplicate the response owned by student1 user1, created on"
    Then I should see "and never modified?"
    And I press "No"

    # Duplicate other modified response
    And I click on "//a[contains(@id,'duplicate_submission_row_2')]" "xpath_element"
