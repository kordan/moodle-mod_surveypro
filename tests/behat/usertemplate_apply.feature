    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I follow "To apply usertemplate"

    And I upload "mod/surveypro/tests/fixtures/usertemplate/parent-child_2015123000.xml" file to "Choose files to import" filemanager
    And I upload "mod/surveypro/tests/fixtures/usertemplate/MMM_2015123000.xml" file to "Choose files to import" filemanager

    And I set the field "Sharing level" to "Course: To apply usertemplate"
    And I press "Import"

    # now I am in the "Manage" page
    And I navigate to "Apply" node in "Surveypro administration > User templates"

    # now I am in the "Apply" page
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | User templates       | (Course) MMM_2015123000.xml |
      | id_action_0          | 1                           |
    And I press "Apply"

    # now I am in the Element > Manage page
    And I follow "hide_item_4"
    And I follow "hide_item_5"
    And I follow "hide_item_6"
    And I follow "hide_item_7"
    And I follow "hide_item_60"

    And I press "Apply"

    Then I should see "This is a demo survey to quickly see"
    Then I should not see "How old is the person shown in the picture, in your personal opinion?"
    And I log out
